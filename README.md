# Running the code

To start the simulation, run main.m file using MATLAB. Parameters can be found at the top of the main.m file. This code was tested using MATLAB R2011b.

# Video

This short video illustrates dynamic area coverage and obstacle avoidance capabilities of 5 α-agents (mobile sensor nodes) controlled by anti-flocking algorithms proposed in the above paper.
